      <p>This is my first coded webpage. I'm pretty excited to learn how to do this and having a skeleton as a starting point makes it a lot easier. I'm really interested in the two projects I can make at Lighthouse Labs and I think I'll choose the movie reviewing site.</p>
      <p>The movie reviewing website coincides really nicely with another project I've been wanting to work on: a venue rating website. I thought I might use a platform like SquareSpace, but the idea of building a database for it that can provide the information quickly is way cool!</p>
